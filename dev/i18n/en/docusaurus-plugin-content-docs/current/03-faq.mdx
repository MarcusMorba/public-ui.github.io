# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **How dependent will I be if I use KoliBri?**<br/>
  If you compare KoliBri with a LEGOÂ® set, then you can simply mix the included building blocks with other building blocks to depict the overall application _(see blue, orange and gray components)_.
- **How can I influence a component if necessary?**<br/>
  KoliBri components are very restrictive to ensure accessibility and are reused through composition. Adjustments from the outside can only be made through **wrapping** or the **expert slot** _(see orange in blue, blue in orange)_. The styling is possible via the **Theme concept** by configuration.
- **What do I do if a component or function is missing?**<br/>
  New **technically neutral components** or **functions** are to be implemented within KoliBri. **Participation** is expressly desired and accelerates the implementation.
